# Design Choices

- **Relationships between Classes/Interfaces:**
  - **styles** is the folder that holds all the css files that manages the front end styling. Much of this was taken from the gear up!
  - **components** is the folder that holds all the front end type script and react files that handles front end logic.
    - **data** This folder has the mockData.js which is a file that contains **mock data**. This mock data is retrieved from the front end
    since we don't have an actual server to return calculated data. Thus, we just have a json that contains samples of realistic data that
    could be returned from a CSV server that is directly being used in our front end.
